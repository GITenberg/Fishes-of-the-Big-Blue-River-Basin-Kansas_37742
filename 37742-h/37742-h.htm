<div class="caption2">INTRODUCTION</div>

<p>The Big Blue River in northeastern Kansas will soon be impounded
by the Tuttle Creek Dam, located about five miles north
of Manhattan, Kansas. Since the inception of this project by the
U. S. Army Corps of Engineers much argument has arisen as to
the values of the dam and reservoir as opposed to the values of
farmland and cultural establishments to be inundated (Schoewe,
1953; Monfort, 1956; and Van Orman, 1956). Also, there has
been some concern about the possible effects of impoundment on
the fish-resources of the area, which supports "a catfish fishery
that is notable throughout most of the State of Kansas and in some
neighboring states (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1953:9)."
The objectives of my study, conducted from March 30, 1957, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
August 9, 1958, were to record the species of fish present and their
relative abundance in the stream system, and to obtain a measure
of angler success prior to closure of the dam. These data may
be used as a basis for future studies on the fish and fishing in the
Big Blue River Basin, Kansas.</p>

<a name="ACKNOWLEDGMENTS" id="ACKNOWLEDGMENTS"></a>
<div class="caption2">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</div>

<p>I thank Messrs. J. E. Deacon, D. A. Distler, Wallace Ferrel, D. L. Hoyt,
F. E. Maendele, C. O. Minckley, B. C. Nelson, and J. C. Tash for assistance
in the field and for valuable suggestions. Dr. J. B. Elder, Kansas State
College, arranged for loan of specimens, and Mr. B. C. Nelson supplied data
on <i>Notropis deliciosus</i> (Girard) in Kansas, and on specimens in the University
of Michigan Museum of Zoology.</p>

<p>I thank the many landowners who allowed me access to streams in the
Big Blue River Basin. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City
District, also allowed access in the reservoir area, and furnished information
and some photographs. Mr. J. C. Tash did chemical determinations on my
water samples.</p>

<p>Dr. Frank B. Cross guided me in this study and in preparation of this report.
Drs. E. Raymond Hall and K. B. Armitage offered valuable suggestions
on the manuscript. Equipment and funds for my study were furnished by
the State Biological Survey of Kansas, and the Kansas Forestry, Fish and
Game Commission granted necessary permits.</p>

<div class="caption2">TUTTLE CREEK DAM AND RESERVOIR</div>

<p>The data on Tuttle Creek Dam and Reservoir that follow were
furnished by Mr. Donald D. Poole, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Kansas City District. The dam, an earth-fill structure, will be
7,500 feet in length, with a maximum height of 157 feet
above the valley floor. Release of water will be from beneath the
west end of the dam, through two tunnels 20 feet in diameter that
have a capacity of 45,000 cubic feet per second; however, releases
exceeding 25,000 c. f. s. are not planned. The gated spillway is
located at the east end of the dam. Freeboard will be 23 feet
at the top of flood-control pool.</p>

<p>The reservoir will have a maximum pool of 2,280,000 acre-feet capacity,
a 53,500-acre surface area, and 368 miles of shoreline.
The present operational plan provides for a conservation pool
having a surface area of 15,700 acres, a shoreline of 112 miles,
and a length of 20 miles.</p>

<div class="caption2">BIG BLUE RIVER BASIN</div>

<p>Big Blue River and its tributaries, a sub-basin of the Kansas
River System, drain approximately 9,600 square miles, of which
2,484 miles are in Kansas (Colby, <i>et al.</i>, 1956:44). The headwaters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
of the Big Blue River are in central Hamilton County,
Nebraska, near the Platte River (<a href="#fig_1">Fig.&nbsp;1</a>). The stream flows generally
south and east for 283 miles to its confluence with the Kansas
River near Manhattan, Kansas. Little Blue River, the largest
tributary to the Big Blue, rises in eastern Kearney and western
Adams counties, Nebraska, and flows southeast for 208 miles to
join the Big Blue near Blue Rapids, Kansas (Nebraska State Planning
Board, 1936:628). The Big Blue River Basin varies in width
from 129 miles in the northwest, to approximately ten miles near
the mouth (Colby, <i>et al.</i>, 1956:44).</p>

<p>In Kansas, outcrops of Pennsylvanian and Cretaceous age occur
along the extreme eastern and western sides of the Big Blue River
Basin, respectively, whereas Permian beds (overlain by Pleistocene
deposits) occur throughout most of the remainder of the watershed
(see Moore and Landes, 1937). The Big Blue and Little
Blue rivers and their tributaries have deeply incised the Permian
beds of the Flint Hills in Kansas, exposing limestones and shales
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
of the Admire, Council Grove, Chase, and Sumner groups (Wolfcampian
and Leonardian series) (Walters, 1954:41-44). Pleistocene
deposits in the Big Blue Basin in Kansas consist of alluvium,
glacial till, and glacial outwash from the Kansan glacial stage,
overlain by loess deposits of Wisconsin and Recent stages (Frye
and Leonard, 1952: pl.&nbsp;1).</p>

<p>The Big Blue River was formed "in part on the till plain surface
and in part by integration of spillway channels," in the latter portion
of the Kansan glaciation (Frye and Leonard, 1952:192). This
stream, and the Republican River to the west, carried waters from
the areas that are now the Platte, Niobrara, and upper Missouri
River basins (Lugn, 1935:153). Drainage was southward, through
Oklahoma, until establishment of the east-flowing Kansas River
(Frye and Leonard, 1952:189-190). As Kansan ice receded the
Blue and Republican rivers retained what is now the Platte River
Basin. The lower Platte River developed and the surface drainage
became distinct in the Iowan (Tazwellian) portion of the Wisconsin
glacial stage (Lugn, 1935:152-153). However, according to Lugn
(1935:203) the Platte River Basin contributes about 300,000 acre-feet
of water per year to the Big Blue and Republican rivers by
percolation through sands and gravels underlying the uplands that
now separate the basins.</p>

<a name="CLIMATE_POPULATION_AND_LAND-USE" id="CLIMATE_POPULATION_AND_LAND-USE"></a>
<div class="caption2">CLIMATE, POPULATION, AND LAND-USE</div>

<p>Climate of the Big Blue River Basin is of the subhumid continental
type, with an average annual precipitation of 22 inches
in the northwest and 30 inches in the southeast. The mean annual
evaporation from water surfaces exceeds annual precipitation by
approximately 30 inches (Colby, <i>et al.</i>, 1956:32-33).</p>

<p>The average annual temperature for the basin is 53&deg;&nbsp;F. (Flora,
1948:148). According to Kincer (1941:704-705) the average
temperature in July, the warmest month, is 78&deg;&nbsp;F., and the
coolest month, January, averages 28&deg;&nbsp;F. Periods of extreme cold
and heat are sometimes of long duration. Length of the growing
season varies from less than 160 days in the northwest to 180 days
in the southeast (Kincer, <i>loc. cit.</i>).</p>

<p>The human population of the Big Blue Basin varies from about
90 persons per square mile in one Nebraska county in the northwest
and one Kansas county in the southeast, to as few as six
persons per square mile in some northeastern counties. The
population is most dense along the eastern border of the basin,
decreasing toward the west. This decrease in population is correlated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
with the decrease in average annual precipitation from east
to west (Colby, <i>et al.</i>, 1956:80).</p>

<p>The principal land-use in the Big Blue Watershed is tilled
crops, with wheat, sorghums, and corn being most important.
Beef cattle are important in some portions of the basin. Colby,
<i>et al.</i> (1956:24) reported that in 1954 as much as 55 per cent of
the land in some counties near the mouth of the Big Blue River
was in pasture. Only one Nebraska county had less than 15 per
cent in pastureland.</p>

<a name="PHYSICAL_FEATURES_OF_STREAMS" id="PHYSICAL_FEATURES_OF_STREAMS"></a>
<div class="caption2">PHYSICAL FEATURES OF STREAMS</div>

<p>Streams of the Big Blue River Basin are of three kinds: turbid,
sandy-bottomed streams, usually 150 to 300 feet in width; relatively
clear, mud-bottomed streams, ten to 60 feet in width; and clear,
deeply incised, gravel-bottomed streams, usually five to 30 feet
in width.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sand-bottomed Streams.</span>&mdash;The Big Blue and Little Blue rivers
represent this kind of stream. The bottoms of these rivers consist
almost entirely of fine sand; nevertheless, their channels are primarily
deep and fairly uniform in width, rather than broad, shallow,
and braided as in the larger Kansas and Arkansas rivers in
Kansas (<a href="#pl11fig1">Plate 11, Fig.&nbsp;1</a>). In the Big Blue River, gravel occurs
rarely on riffles, and gravel-rubble bottoms are found below dams
(<a href="#pl11fig2">Plate 11, Fig.&nbsp;2</a>). The Big Blue flows over a larger proportion
of gravelly bottom than does the Little Blue.</p>

<p>Big Blue River rises at about 1,800 feet above mean sea level
and joins the Kansas River at an elevation of 1,000 feet above
m. s. l. The average gradient is 2.8 feet per mile. Little Blue River,
originating at 2,200 feet, has an average gradient of 5.3 feet per
mile, entering the Big Blue at 1,100 feet above mean sea level
(Nebraska State Planning Board, 1936:628, 637). The Little Blue
is the shallower stream, possibly because of the greater amount
of sandy glacial deposits in its watershed and the swift flow that
may cause lateral cutting, increased movement, and "drifting"
of the sandy bottom.</p>

<p>For approximately a 50-year period, stream-flow in the Big Blue
River at its point of entry into Kansas (Barnston, Nebraska)
averaged 603 cubic feet per second, with maximum and minimum
instantaneous flows of 57,700 c. f. s. and one c. f. s. The Little Blue
River at Waterville, Kansas, averaged a daily discharge of 601
c. f. s. (maximum 50,400, minimum 28). Below the confluence
of the Big Blue and Little Blue rivers, at Randolph, Kansas, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
average daily discharge was 1,690 c.f.s. (maximum 98,000, minimum
31) (Kansas Water Resources Fact-finding and Research
Committee, 1955:27).</p>

<p>The turbidity of the Big Blue River, as determined by use of
a Jackson turbidimeter, varied from 27 parts per million in winter
(January 10, 1958) to as high as 14,000 p.p.m. (July 12, 1958).
The Little Blue River has similar turbidities, with high readings
being frequent. In the summer of 1957, pH ranged from 7.2 to
8.4 in the Big Blue River Basin&mdash;values that correspond closely
with those of Canfield and Wiebe (1931:3) who made 25 determinations
ranging from 7.3 to 8.3 in the streams of the Nebraskan
portion of this basin in July, 1930. Surface temperatures at various
stations varied from 38&deg;&nbsp;F. on January 10, 1958, to 90&deg;&nbsp;F.
in backwater-areas on July 19, 1957. The average surface temperature
at mid-day in July and August, 1957, was approximately
86.5&deg;&nbsp;F.</p>

<p>Chemical determinations were made on water-samples from
my Station 4-S on the Big Blue River, and Station 50-S on the
Little Blue (<a href="#Table_1">Table&nbsp;1</a>). These samples were taken from the surface
in strong current. Determinations were made by methods described
in <i>Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage</i>,
10th edition, 1955.</p>

<p>The banks of both the Big Blue and Little Blue rivers support
narrow riparian forests comprised primarily of elm, <i>Ulmus americanus</i>,
cottonwood, <i>Populus deltoides</i>, sycamore, <i>Platanus occidentalis</i>,
and willow, <i>Salix</i> spp. Maple, <i>Acer</i> sp., oak, <i>Quercus</i> spp.,
and ash, <i>Fraxinus</i> sp. occur where the rivers flow near steep, rocky
hillsides. Many of the hills are virgin bluestem prairies (<i>Andropogon</i>
spp.), but the floodplains are heavily cultivated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mud-bottomed Streams.</span>&mdash;Streams of this kind are present in
the watershed of the Black Vermillion River that enters Big Blue
River from the east. The area east of the Big Blue River and
north of the Black Vermillion River is till plains, where relief seldom
exceeds 100 feet (Walters, 1954:12). Streams in this portion
of the basin, and streams entering the Little Blue River from the
west (Mill Creek and Horseshoe Creek systems), tend to have
V-shaped channels, fewer riffles than the Little Blue and Big Blue
rivers and in the gravelly streams (to be described later), and
have bottoms of mud or clay, with few rocks (<a href="#pl12fig1">Plate 12, Fig.&nbsp;1</a>).
However, in the extreme headwaters of most western tributaries
of the Little Blue River (in Washington and Republic counties)
sandy bottoms predominate. The Black Vermillion River flows
on a broad floodplain and is a mud-bottomed, sluggish stream,
with an average gradient of approximately one foot per mile.
Fringe-forests of elm, cottonwood, sycamore, and willow persist
along most of these stream-courses.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the mud bottoms, the water in this kind of
stream in the Big Blue Basin remains clearer than that of the Big
Blue and Little Blue rivers. Heavy algal blooms were noted in
the Black Vermillion River and Mill Creek, Washington County,
in 1957 and 1958. Temperatures at Stations 45-M and 46-M on
Mill Creek, Washington County, averaged 85.5&deg;&nbsp;F. on July 31, 1957.
Chemical characteristics of a water-sample from Station 35-M,
Black Vermillion River, are in <a href="#Table_1">Table&nbsp;1</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gravel-bottomed Streams.</span>&mdash;Most streams of this kind are tributary
to the Big Blue River; however, streams entering Black Vermillion
River from the south are also of this type (<a href="#pl12fig2">Plate 12, Fig.&nbsp;2</a>).
The streams are "characteristically a series of large pools (to 100
feet in length and more than two feet in depth) connected by short
riffles and smaller pools" (Minckley and Cross, in press). The
average gradients are high: Carnahan Creek, 33 feet per mile;
Mill Creek, Riley County, 21 feet; Clear Creek, 16 feet per mile.
Stream-flow is usually less than five cubic feet per second. In summer,
these streams may become intermittent, but springs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
subsurface percolation maintain pool-levels (Minckley and Cross,
<i>loc. cit.</i>).</p>

<p>The average temperatures of these small streams (79.5&deg;&nbsp;to
81.0&deg;&nbsp;F. in July and August, 1957) were lower than temperatures
in stream-types previously described. Turbidities were usually
less than 25 p.p.m. The chemical properties of water-samples from
two of these streams (Stations 11-G and 18-G) are listed in <a href="#Table_1">Table&nbsp;1</a>.</p>

<a name="PREVIOUS_RECORDS_OF_FISHES" id="PREVIOUS_RECORDS_OF_FISHES"></a>
<div class="caption2">PREVIOUS RECORDS OF FISHES</div>

<p>The earliest records of fishes from the Big Blue River Basin are those of
Cragin (1885) and Graham (1885) in independently published lists of the
fishes of Kansas. Meek (1895) recorded fishes collected in 1891 "from both
branches of the Blue River, a few miles west of Crete, Nebraska." Evermann
and Cox (1896) reported five collections from the Nebraskan part of the
basin. Their collections were made in October, 1892, and August, 1893, and
the stations were: in 1892, Big Blue River at Crete; in 1893, Big Blue River
at Seward, Lincoln Creek at Seward and York, and Beaver Creek at York.</p>

<p>Canfield and Wiebe (1931) obtained fish from 18 localities in Nebraska
in July, 1930; however, their major concern was determination of water quality.
Their stations were: Big Blue River at Stromsburg, Polk Co.; Surprise and
Ulysses, Butler Co.; Staplehurst, Seward, and Milford, Seward Co.; Crete and
Wilber, Saline Co.; Beatrice, Blue Springs, and Barnston, Gage Co.; Little Blue
River at Fairbury, Jefferson Co.; Hebron, Thayer Co.; Sandy Creek at Alexandria,
Thayer Co.; West Fork of Big Blue River at Stockham, Hamilton Co.;
McCool Junction, York Co.; Beaver Crossing, Seward Co.; and Beaver Creek
at York, York Co.</p>

<p>Breukelman (1940) and Jennings (1942) listed fishes from the University
of Kansas Museum of Natural History and the Kansas State College Museum,
respectively, including some specimens collected from the Big Blue River
System in Kansas. Because records in these two papers pertain to collections
that were widely spaced in the basin and in time, the specific localities are not
given herein. One of Jennings' (<i>loc. cit.)</i> records, <i>Scaphirhynchus platorynchus</i>
(Rafinesque), was cited by Bailey and Cross (1954:191). More recently,
Minckley and Cross (in press) recorded several localities, and cited some
papers mentioned above, in a publication dealing with <i>Notropis topeka</i>
(Gilbert) in Kansas.</p>

<p>Information on the fishes of the Nebraskan portion of the Big Blue River
Basin was compiled, and additional localities were reported, in a doctoral
thesis by Dr. Raymond E. Johnson, entitled The Distribution of Nebraska
Fishes, 1942, at the University of Michigan.</p>

<a name="METHODS_AND_MATERIALS" id="METHODS_AND_MATERIALS"></a>
<div class="caption2">METHODS AND MATERIALS</div>

<div class="caption3"><i>Collection of Fishes</i></div>

<p>The gear and techniques used are listed below:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Entrapment Devices.</span>&mdash;Hoop and fyke nets and wire traps were used
for 288 trap/net hours in 1957. The nets were not baited, and were set
parallel to the current, with the mouths downstream. Hoop nets were 1&frac12; to
three feet in diameter at the first hoop, with a pot-mesh of one inch; fyke nets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
were three feet at the first hoop, pot-mesh of one inch; wire traps, with an
opening at each end, were 2&frac12; feet in diameter and covered with one-inch-mesh,
galvanized chicken wire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gill Nets.</span>&mdash;Experimental gill nets were set on three occasions in areas
with little current. These nets were 125 feet in length, with &frac34; to two inch
bar-mesh in 25-foot sections.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seines.</span>&mdash;Seining was used more than other methods. An attempt was
made to seine all habitats at each station. In swift water, seine-hauls were
usually made downstream, but in quiet areas seining was done randomly.
Haul-seines six to 60 feet in length, three to eight feet in depth, and with
meshes of &#8539; to &frac12; inch were used. For collection of riffle-fishes, the seine was
planted below a selected area and the bottom was kicked violently by one
member of the party, while one or two persons held the seine, raising it when
the area had been thoroughly disturbed. Seining on riffles was done with a
four-foot by four-foot bobbinet seine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rotenone.</span>&mdash;Rotenone was used in pools of smaller streams, mouths of
creeks, borrow-pits, and cut-off areas. Both powdered and emulsifiable
rotenone were used. The rotenone was mixed with water and applied by
hand, or into the backwash of an outboard motor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Electric Shocker.</span>&mdash;The electrical unit used in this study generated 115
volts and 600 to 700 watts, alternating current. The shocking unit consisted
of two booms, each with two electrodes, mounted on and operated from a
slowly moving boat. Fish were recovered in scape nets, or in many cases
were identified as they lay stunned and were not collected.</p>

<div class="caption3"><i>Estimation of Relative Abundance</i></div>

<p>Data on relative abundance of fishes were obtained by counts of seine
hauls at 29 of the 59 stations, counts of rotenoned fish at seven stations, and
results with the electric shocker at nine stations. Counts were usually made
in the field; however, in some collections all fish were preserved and counted
in the laboratory. Some fish (or "swirls" presumed to be fish) observed
while shocking were not identified and are not included in the calculations.
However, all fish positively identified while shocking are included.</p>

<div class="caption3"><i>Age and Growth of Fishes</i></div>

<p>Fish from selected size-groups were aged in this study. Scales for age-determinations
were removed from positions recommended by Lagler (1952:108).
Scales were placed in water between glass slides and were read on a
standard scale-projection device.</p>

<p>Pectoral spines of catfish were removed from one or both sides, sectioned,
and read by methods described by Marzolf (1955:243-244).</p>

<p>Calculation of length at the last annulus for both scale-fish and catfish
was made by direct proportion. All measurements are of total length to the
nearest tenth of an inch unless specified otherwise.</p>

<div class="caption3"><i>Creel Census</i></div>

<p>From April 6 to May 28, 1957, a creel census was taken below Turtle Creek
Dam. From June 16 to July 24, 1958, I periodically visited the main points of
access to the Big Blue River, beginning approximately eight miles downstream
from Tuttle Creek Dam and ending six miles upstream from the maximal extension
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
of the reservoir at capacity level. Access-points consisted of 11 bridges,
two power dams, and three areas where county roads approached the river.
Eleven eight-hour days were spent in the 1957 census and 22 checks in 15 days
were made in 1958. An equal number of morning (6:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon)
and afternoon (12:00 noon to 8:30 p.m.) checks were made.</p>

<p>Fishermen contacted were asked the following questions: home address (or
residence at the time of the fishing trip); time they started fishing; kind of fish
sought; number and kinds of fish in possession; and baits used. Also, the
number of poles and type of fishing (from the bank, from boat, <i>etc.</i>) were
recorded. Fishes caught were examined to confirm identifications. About 80
per cent of all fishermen seen were contacted.</p>

<p>Fish per man-hour, as used in this report, refers to the average number of
fish of all species caught by one fisherman in one hour. Fisherman-day is the
average time spent fishing in one day by one person. Because some fishermen
used more than one pole, the data are also expressed as catch per pole-hour.</p>

<a name="COLLECTING_STATIONS" id="COLLECTING_STATIONS"></a>
<div class="caption2">COLLECTING STATIONS</div>

<p>In the list that follows, stations are numbered consecutively from the mouth
of the Big Blue River, listing stations on each tributary as it is ascended. The
letters following station-numbers indicate the general type of stream: S =
sandy; M = muddy; and G = gravelly. The Big Blue River is the boundary
between Riley and Pottawatomie counties, Kansas, along part of its length.
Stations in this area have been designated Riley County. The legal description
of each station is followed by the date(s) of collection, and each station is
plotted in <a href="#fig2">Figure&nbsp;2</a>.</p>

Jennings (1942:364) as <i>Scaphirhynchus platorhynchus</i> (Rafinesque);
Bailey and Cross (1954:191). Stations 3-S and 4-S.</p>

<p>Shovelnose sturgeon were found only in the lower portion of the
Big Blue River. On April 20, 1957, many were seen in fishermen's
creels at Stations 3-S and 4-S. One male and two females that I
examined on that date were ripe or nearly so; eggs seemed well
developed and milt flowed freely from the male. After April, 1957,
none was collected or observed until April 26, 1958, when one
specimen was obtained while shocking. Forbes and Richardson
(1920:27) reported that shovelnose sturgeon spawn in Illinois
between April and June, and Eddy and Surber (1947:80) reported
spawning in May and early June in Wisconsin and Minnesota.</p>

<p><b><i>Lepisosteus platostomus</i></b> Rafinesque, shortnose gar: Jennings
(1942:364). Stations 3-S and 4-S.</p>

<p>I saw shortnose gar at various times in 1956 and 1957 at Rocky
Ford Dam on the Big Blue River (Station 4-S). One was seen
while shocking at Station 3-S on December 26, 1957.</p>

<p><b><i>Lepisosteus osseus</i></b> (Linnaeus), longnose gar: Jennings (1942:364)
as <i>Lepisosteus osseus oxyurus</i> Rafinesque. Stations 1-S, 2-S,
3-S, 4-S, 6-S, 8-S, 9-G, 15-S, 18-G, 25-S, 41-S, 44-S, 52-S, and 53-S.</p>

<p>Longnose gar were abundant in the mainstream of the Big Blue
River but usually evaded capture. This species, and the shortnose
gar, resided in the larger rivers, with <i>L. osseus</i> being taken in only
two creeks near their mouths. In periods of high water, gar moved
into the flooded creeks, but returned to the river as stream-levels
subsided.</p>

<p>Young-of-the-year <i>L. osseus</i>, averaging 21.5 mm. in total length
(range 13 to 30 mm.), were taken on June 14, 1957, and larger young
(estimated 60 to 70 mm. total length) were taken on June 27, 1958.</p>

<p><b><i>Dorosoma cepedianum</i></b> (LeSueur), gizzard shad: Jennings
(1942:364). Stations 1-S, 3-S, 4-S, 6-S, 8-S, 44-S, 45-M, and 53-S.</p>

<p>Most gizzard shad were young-of-the-year, taken on July 16 and
17, 1957, at Stations 3-S and 4-S. Twenty specimens from Station
6-S that were in their second summer of life were from 3.8 to 5.9
inches total length at the last annulus (average 4.3). This species
was usually found in quiet water and was most abundant near the
mouth of the Big Blue River.</p>

<p><b><i>Hiodon alosoides</i></b> (Rafinesque), goldeye. Stations 3-S, 4-S, and
53-S.</p>

<p>I caught five specimens of <i>H. alosoides</i> from the Big Blue River,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
and another specimen, obtained by Dr. R. B. Moorman in 1954, is
at Kansas State College (KSC 4984).</p>

<p>One goldeye that I caught on April 20, 1956, prior to the beginning
of my study, was a ripe female measuring 15.5 inches total
length. The fish was beginning its seventh summer of life.</p>

<p><b><i>Cycleptus elongatus</i></b> LeSueur, blue sucker. The blue sucker is
included on the basis of a single specimen (KSC 2917) collected
by I. D. Graham and labeled "Blue River." No other data are with
the specimen; however, most fishes deposited at Kansas State College
by Graham are dated "1885" or "1886" and were caught near
"Manhattan" (Riley County).</p>

<p><b><i>Ictiobus cyprinella</i></b> (Valenciennes), bigmouth buffalo. Stations
3-S, 6-S, and 30-M.</p>

<p>Bigmouth buffalo were rare, and were taken only in quiet parts
of larger streams, and in the borrow-pit at Station 6-S.</p>

<p><b><i>Ictiobus niger</i></b> (Rafinesque), black buffalo. Stations 3-S, 41-S,
and 53-S.</p>

<p>Only four individuals of <i>I. niger</i> were taken. All were large
adults (more than 20 inches in total length), and all were shocked
in the deeper, swifter areas, where the channel narrowed.</p>

<p><b><i>Ictiobus bubalus</i></b> (Rafinesque), smallmouth buffalo. Stations
1-S, 3-S, 6-S, 7-G, 18-G, 38-S, 41-S, 43-S, 46-M, and 53-S.</p>

<p>This species was found in relatively quiet waters in the main
channel, in cut-off areas, and in creek-mouths. The ages and total
lengths of 30 individuals obtained at Station 6-S were (average
followed by number of fish in parentheses): I, 2.4 (11); II, 4.4
(14); and III, 6.6 (5).</p>

<p>Canfield and Wiebe (1931:6-7, 10) recorded "buffalo-fish" and
"buffalo" from the Big Blue Basin in Nebraska; however, no specific
designation was given.</p>

<p><b><i>Carpiodes forbesi</i></b> Hubbs, plains carpsucker. Station 3-S.</p>

<p>This represents the first record known to me of the plains carpsucker
from Kansas. The specimen (KU 4180), 430 mm. in standard
length, has the following characters: lower lip without a
median, nipple-like projection; dorsal fin-rays, 25; lateral-line scales,
38; diameter of orbit into distance from anterior nostril to tip of
snout, 1.1; body-depth into standard length, 3.3; and head-length
into standard length, 3.9. The specimen was taken while shocking
a wide, shallow channel, over sand bottom.</p>

<p><b><i>Carpiodes carpio carpio</i></b> (Rafinesque), river carpsucker: Jennings
(1942:364). Stations 1-S, 2-S, 3-S, 4-S, 5-G, 6-S, 7-G, 8-S,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
9-G, 11-G, 14-S, 15-S, 18-G, 19-G, 23-G, 25-S, 27-G, 28-G, 30-M,
38-S, 39-S, 41-S, 42-S, 43-S, 44-S, 45-M, 50-S, 52-S, and 53-S.</p>

<p>The river carpsucker occurred at most stations on the larger
streams, and in many of the smaller tributaries. In smaller streams
<i>C. c. carpio</i> frequented the largest pools, in or near the floodplains
of larger streams. A marked preference for still water, soft, silty
bottoms, and areas with drift or other cover was apparent; however,
the species also occurred in open waters with moderate to swift
currents.</p>

<p>The sizes attained by the river carpsucker at different ages were
(averages followed by number of fish in parentheses): I, 1.9 (10);
II, 3.9 (5); III, 5.3 (8); IV, 7.7 (5); V, 11.9 (2); VI, 11.6 (7);
VII, 12.8 (6); VIII, 13.1 (1); IX, 14.9 (2); X, 15.8 (8); and XI,
17.6 (1). These averages are significantly less than those reported
by Buchholz (1957:594) for the river carpsucker in the Des
Moines River, Iowa.</p>

<p>Examination of the gonads of river carpsucker in summer, 1957,
indicated that spawning occurred in late July. Young-of-the-year,
averaging 21 mm. in total length, first appeared in my collections
on July 30, 1957.</p>

<p><b><i>Carpiodes velifer</i></b> (Rafinesque), highfin carpsucker: Meek
(1895:135); Evermann and Cox (1896:389).</p>

<p>The highfin carpsucker was not taken in my survey. Meek
(1895:135) reported "this small sucker [<i>C. velifer</i>] ... common
in Blue River at Crete," characterizing the specimens as having
"Dorsal rays, 24 to 30; scales in the lateral-line, 36 to 41; head
3&frac34; to 4; and depth 2&frac12; to 3." The ranges in the number of dorsal
rays and the number of scales in the lateral-line are higher than
usual in <i>C. velifer</i>, or in <i>C. c. carpio</i>, which is now common in the
Big Blue River Basin. Both species normally have 33 to 37 lateral-line
scales and 27 or fewer dorsal rays (Bailey, 1956:352-353;
Moore, 1957:79; and Trautman, 1957:81-82). The other characters
listed by Meek would fit the young and some adults of either
species, or possibly a composite including <i>C. forbesi</i>.</p>

<p>Graham (1885:72) and Cragin (1885:107) reported <i>Ictiobus
velifer</i> (= <i>Carpiodes velifer</i>) from "Eureka Lake," Riley County,
Kansas. This lake, which no longer exists, was in the Kansas River
Valley, about ten miles upstream from the mouth of the Big Blue
River. Other, more recent records from the Kansas River Basin,
in the vicinity of the Big Blue River, are: Maple Leaf Lake, Riley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
Co., Oct. 4, 1925; Deep Creek, Riley Co., no date; Wildcat Creek,
Riley Co., Sept. 7, 1923; and Wildcat Creek, Riley Co., Sept. 29,
1925 (UMMZ 122187-90). Most of the collections were made by
Minna E. Jewell (Nelson, personal communication).</p>

<p><b><i>Moxostoma aureolum</i></b> (LeSueur), northern redhorse: Cragin
(1885:108) as <i>Moxostoma macrolepidotum</i> LeSueur; Meek (1895:136)
as <i>Moxostoma macrolepidotum duquesnei</i> (LeSueur); Evermann
and Cox (1896:394-395); and Jennings (1942:364) as <i>Moxostoma
erythrurum</i> (Rafinesque). Stations 41-S, 43-S, 44-S, and
53-S.</p>

<p>I collected three northern redhorse from the Big Blue River
Basin, and another specimen was seined in the mouth of Mill Creek,
Riley County (my present Station 9-G) by the Kansas State College
class in fisheries management in 1954 (KSC 5068). I reidentify
as <i>M. aureolum</i> the two specimens recorded by Jennings (<i>loc. cit.</i>)
as <i>M. erythrurum</i>.</p>

<p>The subspecific status of <i>M. aureolum</i> in the Kansas River Basin is
to be the subject of another paper.</p>

<p><b><i>Catostomus commersonnii</i></b> (Lacépède), white sucker: Canfield
and Wiebe (1931:8) as "common suckers"; and Breukelman (1940:380).
Stations 7-G, 11-G, 12-G, 13-G, 16-G, 18-G, 19-G, 23-G,
29-G, 31-G, 53-S, 57-M, and 58-G.</p>

<p>The white sucker occurred primarily in upland streams of the
Flint Hills, with one occurrence in muddy habitat, and one in the
main stream of the Big Blue River. Young <i>C. commersonnii</i> were
often taken in riffles, but adults were in the larger, deeper pools.
The ages and total lengths at the last annulus for 12 white suckers
were: I, 2.8 (4); II, 3.9 (6); III, 8.2 (1); and IV, 9.2 (1).</p>

<p><b><i>Cyprinus carpio</i></b> Linnaeus, carp: Canfield and Wiebe (1931:5-8,
10) as "carp." Stations 1-S, 2-S, 3-S, 4-S, 6-S, 7-G, 8-S, 15-S,
16-G, 18-G, 23-G, 24-G, 25-S, 27-G, 30-M, 35-M, 38-S, 41-S, 42-S,
43-S, 44-S, 45-M, 52-S, 53-S, and 56-S.</p>

<p>Carp occurred throughout the basin. The habitat of this species
closely approximated that of the river carpsucker; however,
carp were more often taken in moderate to swift water than were
<i>C. c. carpio</i>.</p>

<p>The ages and average lengths at the last annulus for 40 carp from
the Big Blue River Basin were: I, 2.3 (4); II, 4.7 (10); III, 7.0 (10);
IV, 9.0 (3); V, 11.3 (4); VI, 18.6 (1); VII, 18.9 (3); VIII, no fish;
IX, 20.6 (3); X, 19.1 (2); XI, 21.1 (1); XII, 22.0 (1); and XIII,
24.1 (2).</p>

<p><b><i>Carassius auratus</i></b> (Linnaeus), goldfish. Station 4-S.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw goldfish seined from Station 4-S by anglers obtaining bait
on April 20, 1957. Goldfish were commonly used for bait at Stations
4-S and 54-S.</p>

<p><b><i>Semotilus atromaculatus</i></b> (Mitchill), creek chub: Evermann and
Cox (1896:399); and Jennings (1942:364) as <i>Semotilus atromaculatus
atromaculatus</i> (Mitchill). Stations 5-G, 7-G, 10-G, 11-G,
12-G, 13-G, 16-G, 17-G, 18-G, 23-G, 24-G, 27-G, 28-G, 29-G, 31-G,

50-S, 53-S, 54-G, 55-M, 56-S, 57-M, 58-G, and 59-G.</p>

<p>Creek chubs were found in all habitats in the Big Blue River
Basin, but were abundant only in the headwaters of muddy streams
and in clear upland creeks.</p>

<p><b><i>Chrosomus erythrogaster</i></b> (Rafinesque), southern redbelly dace:
Jennings (1942:365). Stations 11-G, 12-G, 13-G, 16-G, 27-G, 29-G,
and 53-S.</p>

<p>This colorful species occupied the headwaters of the clear,
spring-fed creeks where it was abundant. Only one specimen was
taken in muddy or sandy habitat (at the mouth of a small creek at
Station 53-S), where it may have been washed by floods just prior
to my collecting.</p>

<p><b><i>Hybopsis storeriana</i></b> (Kirtland), silver chub. Station 3-S.</p>

<p>One specimen of <i>H. storeriana</i> (KU 3810) was seined in swift
water near a sandbar on April 6, 1957, and another was taken at
the same locality on April 26, 1958.</p>

<p><b><i>Hybopsis aestivalis</i></b> (Girard), speckled chub: Meek (1895:137);
and Evermann and Cox (1896:409), both as <i>Hybopsis hyostomus</i>
Gilbert. Stations 3-S, 4-S, 14-S, 25-S, 38-S, 39-S, 50-S, and 56-S.</p>

<p>This species was restricted to wide, swift parts of the Big Blue
and Little Blue rivers, and was found over clean, sometimes shifting,
sand bottoms. On May 29, 1958, three males in breeding condition
were collected and on June 16, 1958, a large series of both
male and female <i>H. aestivalis</i>, all with well-developed gonads, was
collected. The water temperature was 77.0&deg;&nbsp;F. Hubbs and Ortenburger
(1929:25-26) reported that <i>Extrarius tetranemus</i> (Gilbert)
(= <i>Hybopsis aestivalis tetranemus</i>) spawns in summer especially
in early July. Cross (1950:135) reported a single pair of <i>H. a.
tetranemus</i> that he considered in breeding condition on June 9, 1948.</p>

<p>Breukelman (1940:380) recorded speckled chubs in the Kansas
River Basin as <i>Extrarius</i> (= <i>Hybopsis</i>) <i>aestivalis</i>: <i>sesquialis</i> ×
<i>tetranemus</i>; however, the name <i>sesquialis</i> is a <i>nomen nudum</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
the status of this species in the Kansas River Basin is yet to be
elucidated.</p>

<p><b><i>Phenacobius mirabilis</i></b> (Girard), plains suckermouth minnow:
Meek (1895:136); and Evermann and Cox (1896:408). Stations
2-S, 3-S, 4-S, 5-G, 6-S, 7-G, 8-S, 9-G, 11-G, 16-G, 18-G, 25-S, 26-G,
27-G, 35-M, 38-S, 39-S, 40-M, 42-S, 47-M, 50-S, 52-S, 53-S, 54-G,
and 56-S.</p>

<p><i>Phenacobius mirabilis</i> was widespread in the basin, occurring
most frequently on riffles over bottoms of clean sand or gravel.
Young-of-the-year were usually taken in backwaters.</p>

<p><b><i>Notropis percobromus</i></b> (Cope), plains shiner. Stations 3-S and
4-S.</p>

<p>The plains shiner occurred only in the lower part of the main
stream of the Big Blue River.</p>

<p><b><i>Notropis rubellus</i></b> (Agassiz), rosyface shiner. Station 5-G.</p>

<p>One rosyface shiner (KU 4195) was taken. This species was previously
reported from only two localities in the Kansas River Basin:
in the Mill Creek Watershed, Wabaunsee County, and Blacksmith
Creek, Shawnee County as <i>Notropis rubrifrons</i> (Cope) (Gilbert,
1886:208). Mill Creek and Blacksmith Creek are northward-flowing
tributaries of the Kansas River that arise in the Flint Hills.
Graham (1885:73) also recorded <i>N. rubellus</i> (as <i>N. rubrifrons</i>)
from the "Kansas and Missouri Rivers"; however, I suspect that his
specimens were <i>Notropis percobromus</i>, a species not generally
recognized in Graham's time (see Hubbs, 1945:16-17). <i>Notropis
rubellus</i> is now abundant in the Mill Creek Watershed (Wabaunsee
County), but, except for my specimen No. 4195, has not been taken
recently in other streams in the Kansas River Basin.</p>

<p><b><i>Notropis umbratilis umbratilis</i></b> (Girard), redfin shiner. Station
3-S.</p>

<p>One specimen of <i>N. u. umbratilis</i> was captured near a sandbar
on March 26, 1958. The absence of this species in Flint Hills
streams of the Big Blue River Basin is unexplained; redfin shiners
occur commonly in southern tributaries of the Kansas River both
upstream and downstream from the mouth of the Big Blue River.
In Kansas this species is usually associated with the larger pools
of clear, upland streams.</p>

<p>Canfield and Wiebe (1931:6-8) may have referred to this species
in recording "black-fin minnows" from the Nebraskan portion of
the Big Blue River Basin.</p>

<p><b><i>Notropis cornutus frontalis</i></b> (Agassiz), common shiner. Stations

29-G, 31-G, 32-G, and 59-G.</p>

<p>Common shiners were most abundant in middle sections of the
clear, gravelly creeks.</p>

<p><b><i>Notropis lutrensis</i></b> (Baird and Girard), red shiner: Meek (1895:136);
and Evermann and Cox (1896:404-405). All stations excepting
1-S, 17-G, 30-M, and 51-M.</p>

<p>Red shiners were the most widespread species taken in my survey,
occurring in all habitats, and in all kinds of streams. On two
occasions I observed what apparently was spawning behavior of
this species. Both times the specimens collected were in the
height of breeding condition, stripping in the hand easily, and
often without pressure. At the first locality (Station 29-G) no attempt
was made to obtain eggs, but by disturbing the bottom at
the second (55-M) I found eggs that were thought to be those of
red shiners. The eggs were slightly adhesive, clinging to the hand
and to the bobbinet seine.</p>

<p>On June 29, 1958, at Station 29-G, red shiners appeared to be
spawning in an open-water area measuring about 15 by 15 feet,
over nests of <i>Lepomis cyanellus</i> Rafinesque and <i>L. humilis</i> (Girard).
No interspecific activity was noted between the sunfish and the red
shiners. Water temperature at this station was 73.4&deg;&nbsp;F., and the
bottom was gravel, sand, and mud. Observations were made from
a high cut-bank, by naked eye and by use of 7-X binoculars.</p>

<p>The red shiners moved rapidly at the surface of the water, with
one male (rarely two or more) following one female. The male
followed closely, passing the female and causing her to change
direction. At the moment of the female's hesitation, prior to her
turn, the male would erect his fins in display, at the side and a little
in front of the female. After brief display, usually less than two
seconds, the male resumed the chase, swimming behind and around
the female in a spiral fashion. After a chase of two to three feet,
the female would sometimes allow the male to approach closely on
her left side. The male nudged the female on the caudal peduncle
and in the anal region, moving alongside with his head near the
lower edge of the left operculum of the female, thus placing his
genital pore about a head-length behind and below that of the
female. At this time spawning must have occurred; however,
possibly because of the speed of the chase, I observed no vibration
of the fish as described for other species of <i>Notropis</i> at the culmination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
of spawning (Pfeiffer, 1955:98; Raney, 1947:106; and others).
While the spawning act presumably occurred the pair was in
forward motion in a straight course, for three to five feet, at the
end of which the male moved rapidly away, gyrating to the side
and down. The female then swam away at a slower rate. In
instances when the female failed to allow the male to move alongside,
the male sometimes increased his speed, striking the female,
and often causing her to jump from the water.</p>

<p>Some conflict between males was observed, usually when two
or more followed one female. The males would leave the female,
swerve to one side, and stop, facing each other or side by side. At
this moment the fins were greatly elevated in display. There was
usually a rush on the part of one male, resulting in the flight of
the other, and the aggressive male would pursue for about two feet.
Many times the pursued male jumped from the water.</p>

<p>At Station 55-M, on July 9, 1958, activity similar to that described
above was observed in a small pool near a mass of debris. At this
station I watched from the bank, three feet from the spawning
shiners. Water temperature was not recorded.</p>

<p>The minnows performed the same types of chase and display,
all in open water, as described for Station 29-G, However, at Station
55-M, much activity of males occurred near the small deposit
of debris. It seemed that conflict was taking place, with males behaving
as described above, and milling violently about. Examination
of the area revealed nests of <i>L. cyanellus</i> near the debris, and
some of the activity by the shiners may have been raids on nests of
the sunfish. However, females nearing the group of males were
immediately chased by one to four individual males, with one
usually continuing pursuit after a short chase by the group. The
male again moved into position at the lower left edge of the operculum
of the female as at Station 29-G.</p>

<p>Another kind of behavior was observed also, in which the
female sometimes stopped. The male approached, erecting his
fins and arching his body to the left. The female also assumed this
arch to the left, and the pair moved in a tight, counter-clockwise
circle, with the male on the inside. After a short period in this
position, the male moved aside in display, and gyrated to the side
and down. Females at both stations moved about slowly, usually
remaining in the immediate vicinity of activity by males, and returning
to the area even when pursued and deserted some distance
away.</p>

and Jennings (1942:365) as <i>Notropis deliciosus missuriensis</i> (Cope).
All stations excepting 1-S, 10-G, 12-G, 17-G, 20-G, 21-G, 22-G,
24-G, 29-G, 30-M, 31-G, 32-G, 33-M, 35-M, 51-M, 55-M, 57-M, 58-G,
and 59-G.</p>

<p>Nelson (personal communication) has studied the sand shiner in
Kansas, and has found that the Big Blue River is an area of intergradation
between the southwestern subspecies (<i>deliciosus</i>) and the
plains subspecies (<i>missuriensis</i>). <i>Notropis d. deliciosus</i> prefers
cool, rocky habitat, and occurs in small streams of the Flint Hills,
whereas <i>N. d. missuriensis</i> occupies the sandy, turbid Big Blue and
Little Blue rivers. Intergrades occur most frequently in the Big
Blue River, but are found in all habitats.</p>

<p><b><i>Notropis topeka</i></b> (Gilbert), Topeka shiner: Meek (1895:136);
Evermann and Cox (1896:403); and Minckley and Cross (in press).
Stations 10-G, 11-G, 12-G, 19-G, 31-G, and 32-G.</p>

<p>This species was common locally in the upland streams. Female
Topeka shiners stripped easily at Station 11-G on July 8, 1958, and
adult <i>N. topeka</i> in high breeding condition were collected at Station
31-G on July 14, 1958. The water temperature at both stations
was 77.5&deg;&nbsp;F. Evermann and Cox (1896:403-404) recorded female
Topeka shiners "nearly ripe" on June 29, 1893.</p>

<p><b><i>Notropis buchanani</i></b> Meek, ghost shiner. Stations 3-S and 4-S.
Only two specimens of <i>N. buchanani</i> were taken, both on
August 14, 1957. These specimens (KU 3833), a female with
well-developed ova, and a tuberculate male, were near a sandbar
in the main channel. To my knowledge, this is the first published
record of the ghost shiner from the Kansas River Basin. Mr. James
Booth, State Biological Survey, collected <i>N. buchanani</i> from two
stations on Mill Creek, Wabaunsee County, Kansas, 1953.</p>

<p><b><i>Hybognathus nuchalis</i></b> Agassiz, silvery minnow. Stations 2-S,
3-S, 4-S, 7-G, 8-S, and 16-G.</p>

<p>This species was taken sporadically, but sometimes abundantly,
in the Big Blue River. At Stations 7-G and 16-G a few young-of-the-year
were found.</p>

<p>Bailey (1956:333) does not consider the southwestern <i>Hybognathus
placita</i> (Girard) specifically distinct from the northeastern
<i>H. nuchalis</i>, but little evidence of intergradation has been published.
In <a href="#Table_2">Table&nbsp;2</a>, I have compared measurements and counts
of 50 specimens of <i>Hybognathus</i> from the Big Blue River, 50 <i>H. n.
placita</i> from the Walnut River, Kansas (Arkansas River Basin),
and 50 <i>H. n. nuchalis</i> from Wisconsin. Measurements and counts
were made by methods described by Hubbs and Lagler (1947:8-15)
and measurements are expressed as thousandths of standard length.</p>

<p><i>Hybognathus</i> from the Big Blue River tend to have fewer, larger
scales than <i>H. n. placita</i> from the Walnut River, Kansas, but more
and smaller scales than <i>H. n. nuchalis</i> from Wisconsin. In specimens
from the Blue River, the size of the orbit divided by standard
length, and the width of gape divided by standard length and
width of orbit, are also intermediate between the Walnut River and
Wisconsin specimens, but tend toward the former. Specimens from
the Big Blue River resemble <i>H. n. placita</i> from the Walnut River
in body shape, robustness, and in the embedding of scales on the
nape.</p>

<p><b><i>Pimephales notatus</i></b> (Rafinesque), bluntnose minnow: Meek
(1895:136); and Evermann and Cox (1896:399). Stations 2-S, 3-S,
5-G, 6-S, 8-S, 9-G, 10-G, 11-G, 12-G, 13-G, 16-G, 19-G, 27-G, 29-G,
53-S, 54-G, and 58-G.</p>

<p>The bluntnose minnow preferred the clearer creeks, with gravel
or gravel-silt bottoms, but occurred rarely in the mainstream of the
Big Blue River. Males and females in high breeding condition
were taken on July 14, 1958. The temperature of the water was
75.5&deg;&nbsp;F.</p>

<p><b><i>Pimephales promelas</i></b> Rafinesque, fathead minnow: Meek (1895:
136); and Evermann and Cox (1896:397-398). All stations excepting
1-S, 4-S, 12-G, 30-M, 43-S, 44-S, and 56-S.</p>

<p>Small muddy streams were preferred by <i>P. promelas</i>; however,
the fathead minnow was taken in all habitats, and in association
with most other species.</p>

<p>Canfield and Wiebe (1931:6-7) may have recorded <i>P. promelas</i>
from the Big Blue River Basin, Nebraska, as "blackhead minnows."</p>

<p><b><i>Campostoma anomalum plumbeum</i></b> (Girard), stoneroller. All
stations excepting 1-S, 2-S, 3-S, 14-S, 15-S, 21-G, 22-G, 28-G, 30-M,
33-M, 34-M, 35-M, 36-M, 37-M, 38-S, 41-S, 44-S, 45-M, 51-M,
52-S, and 55-M.</p>

<p>Stonerollers were usually taken in riffles with gravel-rubble bottoms.
Those individuals collected in areas with mud or sand
bottoms were almost invariably in the current, or in the edge of
currents.</p>

<p>Specimens from the Big Blue River Basin have an average of
47.4 scale-rows around the body (range 42-54).</p>

<p><b><i>Ictalurus melas</i></b> (Rafinesque), black bullhead: Evermann and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
Cox (1896:387) as <i>Ameiurus melas</i> (Rafinesque); and Canfield
and Wiebe (1931:5-7, 10) as "bullheads." Stations 2-S, 6-S, 7-G,
11-G, 16-G, 20-G, 22-G, 23-G, 24-G, 28-G, 35-M, 40-M, 51-M, 53-S,
55-M, 56-S, 57-M, and 58-G.</p>

<p>Black bullhead occurred in all habitats, but were less commonly
taken in the Big Blue and Little Blue rivers than in other streams.</p>

<p><b><i>Ictalurus natalis</i></b> (LeSueur), yellow bullhead. Stations 7-G, 9-G,
10-G, 11-G, 17-G, 18-G, 19-G, 34-M, 35-M, 36-M, 37-M, 40-M, 47-M,
48-M, 53-S, and 55-M.</p>

<p>The yellow bullhead inhabited the muddy-bottomed streams and
the upland, gravelly creeks, usually occurring in the headwaters.
I obtained only one <i>I. natalis</i> in the sandy Big Blue River.</p>

<p><b><i>Ictalurus punctatus</i></b> (Rafinesque), channel catfish: Cragin (1885:107);
Meek (1895:135); Evermann and Cox (1896:386); and Canfield
and Wiebe (1931:6-7, 10) as "channel catfish." Stations 1-S,
2-S, 3-S, 4-S, 5-G, 6-S, 7-G, 8-S, 9-G, 11-G, 14-S, 15-S, 16-G, 18-G,
25-S, 27-G, 30-M, 35-M, 38-S, 39-S, 41-S, 42-S, 43-S, 44-S, 46-M,
50-S, 51-M, 52-S, 53-S, and 56-S.</p>

<p>Channel catfish were most common in the larger, sandy streams,
but occurred in other kinds of streams. The ages and calculated
total lengths at the last annulus for 40 channel catfish were: I, no
fish; II, 7.3 (16); III, 10.6 (5); IV, 12.3 (5); V, 13.3 (6); VI, 15.5
(4); VII, 18.0 (3); and VIII, 21.9 (1). These lengths are slightly
lower than averages reported by Finnell and Jenkins (1954:5) in
Oklahoma impoundments.</p>

<p>The length-frequency distribution of 438 channel catfish, collected
by rotenone on August 5 and 7, 1958, indicated that two
age-groups were represented. Without examination of spines, I
assigned 265 fish to age-group O (1.3 to 2.9 inches, average 2.5)
and 173 fish to age-group I (3.1 to 5.8 inches, average 4.5). The
average total length of age group I (4.5 inches) is only slightly
higher than the total length at the first annulus reported as average
for Oklahoma (4.0 inches, Finnell and Jenkins, <i>loc. cit.</i>). It seems
unlikely that my yearling fish taken in August, 1958, would have
reached the length at the second annulus recorded in my study of
spines (7.3 inches) by the end of the 1958 growing season.</p>

<p>From 1952 to 1956, severe drought was prevalent in Kansas,
probably causing streams to flow less than at any previously recorded
time (Minckley and Cross, in press). This drought must
have resulted in reduced populations of fishes in the streams. The
channel catfish hatched in 1956 were therefore subjected to low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
competition for food and space when normal flow was resumed in
1957, and grew rapidly, reaching an average total length of 7.3
inches at the second annulus, while channel catfish that were members
of the large 1957 and 1958 hatches suffered more competition
and grew more slowly.</p>

<p><b><i>Noturus flavus</i></b> Rafinesque, stonecat: Jennings (1942:365). Stations
3-S, 4-S, 6-S, 16-G, 25-S, 28-G, 38-S, 41-S, 42-S, 43-S, 52-S, 53-S,
and 56-S.</p>

<p><i>Noturus flavus</i> frequented riffles and swift currents along sandbars
in the Big Blue and Little Blue rivers. Cross (1954:311) reported
that "the shale-strewn riffles of the South Fork [of the
Cottonwood River, Kansas] provide ideal habitat for the stonecat."
In my study-area, this species was found not only on rubble-bottomed
riffles, but occurred along both stationary and shifting
sandbars where no cover was apparent.</p>

<p><b><i>Pylodictis olivaris</i></b> (Rafinesque), flathead catfish: Canfield and
Wiebe (1931:7) as "yellow catfish." Stations 3-S, 4-S, 6-S, 8-S,
15-S, 25-S, 38-S, 41-S, 43-S, 44-S, 53-S, and 56-S.</p>

<p>Flathead catfish were found only in the larger rivers. The species
was taken rarely by seine, but was readily obtained by electric
shocker. Data on the age and growth and food-habits of this
species are to be the subject of another paper.</p>

<p><b><i>Anguilla bostoniensis</i></b> (LeSueur), American eel: Jennings (1942:365).</p>

<p>American eels are now rare in Kansas, and none was taken in my
survey. The specimen reported by Jennings (<i>loc. cit.</i>) is at Kansas
State College (KSC 2916), and was taken by I. D. Graham from
the Big Blue River, Riley County, 1885.</p>

<p><b><i>Fundulus kansae</i></b> Garman, plains killifish. Station 42-S.</p>

<p>The plains killifish was collected by me only at Station 42-S.
Specimens were collected from my Station 4-S by the Kansas State
College class in fisheries management in 1954 (KSC 4985). My
specimens were 11 to 13 mm. in total length.</p>

<p><b><i>Roccus chrysops</i></b> (Rafinesque), white bass. Station 3-S.</p>

<p>That the white bass is indigenous to Kansas is evidenced by
records of Graham (1885:77) and Cragin (1885:111); however,
since that time, and prior to the introduction of this species into
reservoirs in the State, <i>R. chrysops</i> has rarely been recorded in
Kansas. I collected young white bass at Station 3-S in both 1957
and 1958, and I collected them also in an oxbow of the Kansas River
four miles west of Manhattan, Riley County, Kansas, in the mouth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
of McDowell's Creek, Riley County, and in Deep Creek, Wabaunsee
County, and I saw other specimens from an oxbow of the
Kansas River on the Fort Riley Military Reservation, Riley County,
Kansas. The apparent increase in abundance of white bass in the
Kansas River Basin must be attributable to introductions in reservoirs,
with subsequent escape and establishment in the streams.</p>

<p><b><i>Micropterus salmoides salmoides</i></b> (Lacépède), largemouth bass.
Stations 6-S, 11-G, 43-S, and 45-M.</p>

<p>Four largemouth bass were taken. This species has been widely
stocked in farm-ponds and other impoundments in Kansas.</p>

<p><b><i>Lepomis cyanellus</i></b> Rafinesque, green sunfish: Breukelman (1940:382);
and Canfield and Wiebe (1931:5, 7-8, 10) as "green sunfish."
All stations excepting 1-S, 2-S, 4-S, 8-S, 9-G, 15-S, 22-G, 25-S,
30-M, 32-G, 34-M, 38-S, 39-S, 41-S, 42-S, 43-S, 44-S, 45-M, 46-M,
47-M, 50-S, and 52-S.</p>

<p>Green sunfish occurred primarily in the muddy streams. The ages
and total lengths at the last annulus for 25 specimens are as follows:
I, 1.1 (9); II, 2.2 (4); III, 3.1 (7); IV, 5.4 (4); and V, 6.0 (1).
Male green sunfish were seen on nests on June 29, July 1, and
July 9, 1958.</p>

<p><b><i>Lepomis humilis</i></b> (Girard), orangespotted sunfish: Meek (1895:137);
Evermann and Cox (1896:418); Canfield and Wiebe (1931:6)
as "orange spots"; and Breukelman (1940:382). All stations excepting
1-S, 9-G, 13-G, 15-G, 17-G, 21-G, 26-G, 34-M, 36-M, 38-M, 43-M,
44-S, 47-M, 50-S, and 52-S.</p>

<p><i>Lepomis humilis</i> was most common over sand-silt bottoms. Only
two age-groups were found; their calculated total lengths were
I, 1.7 (15); and II, 2.4 (10). Orangespotted sunfish were seen nesting
on the same dates as <i>Lepomis cyanellus</i>.</p>

<p><b><i>Lepomis macrochirus</i></b> Rafinesque, bluegill. Stations 7-G, 13-G,
16-G, 24-G, and 59-G.</p>

<p>This species has been widely stocked in Kansas. Only young-of-the-year
and sub-adults were taken, and these were rare.</p>

<p><b><i>Pomoxis annularis</i></b> Rafinesque, white crappie: Canfield and
Wiebe (1931:5-8, 10) as "white crappie." Stations 3-S, 6-S, 8-S,
12-G, 42-S, and 53-S.</p>

<p>White crappie were rare, except in a borrow-pit at Station 6-S.
Ages and calculated total lengths at the last annulus for 50 specimens
from 6-S are as follows: I, 3.6 (22); II, 5.0 (14); III, 7.1 (5);
IV, 8.3 (7); and V, 10.7 (2).</p>

<p><b><i>Pomoxis nigromaculatus</i></b> (LeSueur), black crappie. Station 6-S.</p>

<p>One black crappie (KU 4174) was taken. Canfield and Wiebe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
(1931:10) noted: "The Black Crappie has been planted here [Big
Blue River Basin in Nebraska] by the State, but, apparently, is not
propagating itself."</p>

<p><b><i>Stizostedion canadense</i></b> (Smith), sauger. Station 56-S.</p>

<p>Mr. Larry Stallbaumer, of Marysville, Kansas, obtained a sauger
(KU 4179) while angling on May 25, 1958.</p>

<p><b><i>Stizostedion vitreum</i></b> (Mitchill), walleye.</p>

<p>Though I failed to obtain the walleye in my survey, Dr. Raymond
E. Johnson (personal communication) reported that the
species occurred in the Nebraskan portion of the Big Blue River
in recent years. Canfield and Wiebe (1931:6, 10) reported that
"yellow pike are taken at Crete [Nebraska]," but may have referred
to either the walleye or the sauger.</p>

<p><b><i>Perca flavescens</i></b> (Mitchill), yellow perch: Canfield and Wiebe
(1931:5-6, 10) as "ring perch" and "yellow perch."</p>

<p>This fish was not taken in my survey. Canfield and Wiebe (<i>loc.
cit</i>.) reported that the yellow perch "had been planted by the
State [Nebraska]."</p>

<p><b><i>Etheostoma nigrum nigrum</i></b> Rafinesque, johnny darter: Jennings
(1942:365) as <i>Boleosoma nigrum nigrum</i> (Rafinesque). Stations
10-G, 11-G, 12-G, 13-G, 16-G, 29-G, 40-M, 53-S, and 54-G.</p>

<p>The larger pools of gravelly streams were preferred by johnny
darters, but one specimen was taken from the main stream of the

hard, sand-silt bottom.</p>

<p><b><i>Etheostoma spectabile pulchellum</i></b> (Girard), orangethroat
darter: Jennings (1942:365) as <i>Poecilichthys spectabilis pulchellus</i>
(Girard). Stations 5-G, 7-G, 10-G, 11-G, 12-G, 13-G, 16-G, 17-G,
18-G, 21-G, 23-G, 27-G, 28-G, 29-G, 33-M, 40-M, 49-M, 53-S,
54-G, and 59-G.</p>

<p>The orangethroat darter was less restricted in habitat than the
johnny darter, occurring in all stream-types, but most often in the
riffles of gravelly streams. Most specimens from muddy or sandy
streams were small.</p>

<p><b><i>Aplodinotus grunniens</i></b> Rafinesque, freshwater drum. Stations
3-S, 4-S, 6-S, 7-G, 8-S, 15-S, 38-S, 39-S, 53-S, and 56-S.</p>

<p>The ages and calculated total lengths at the last annulus for 42
freshwater drum from the Big Blue River were: I, 3.0 (10); II,
5.7 (6); III, 9.4 (7); IV, 12.1 (13); V, 14.0 (3); VI, 15.1 (2); and

<p>I obtained two hybrid fishes in my study-area. One specimen of
<i>Notropis cornutus frontalis</i> × <i>Chrosomus erythrogaster</i> was taken
at Station 29-G. This combination was recorded by Trautman
(1957:114) in Ohio. The other hybrid was <i>Lepomis cyanellus</i> ×
<i>Lepomis humilis</i>, captured at Station 24-G. This combination was
first recorded by Hubbs and Ortenburger (1929:42).</p>

<p>Hubbs and Bailey (1952:144) recorded another hybrid combination
from my area of study: <i>Campostoma anomalum plumbeum</i> ×
<i>Chrosomus erythrogaster</i>, UMMZ 103132, from a "spring-fed creek
on 'Doc' Wagner's farm, Riley County, Kansas; September 21,
1927; L. O. Nolf [collector]."</p>

<a name="RELATIVE_ABUNDANCE_AND_DISCUSSION_OF_SPECIES" id="RELATIVE_ABUNDANCE_AND_DISCUSSION_OF_SPECIES"></a>
<div class="caption2">RELATIVE ABUNDANCE AND DISCUSSION OF SPECIES</div>

<p>The relative abundance of different species was estimated by
combining counts of individual fishes taken in 290 seine-hauls, 26
hours and 15 minutes of shocking, and seven samples obtained with
rotenone. At some stations all seine-hauls were counted. At other
stations the seine-hauls in which complete counts were recorded
had been selected randomly in advance; that is to say, prior to
collecting at each station. I selected those hauls to be counted
from a table of random numbers (Snedecor, 1956:10-13). I did
not use the frequency-of-occurrence method as proposed by Starrett
(1950:114), in which the species taken and not the total number
of individuals are recorded for all seine-hauls. However, the frequency
of occurrence of each species is indicated by the number
of stations at which it was found, and those stations are listed in
the previous accounts. <a href="#Table_3">Table 3</a> shows the percentage of the total
number of fish that each species comprised in three kinds of streams:
sandy (Big Blue and Little Blue rivers), muddy, and gravelly
streams.</p>

<p>The habitat preferences of some species affect their abundance
in different stream-types. <i>Notropis lutrensis</i> and <i>P. mirabilis</i> seemed
almost ubiquitous. <i>Notropis deliciosus</i> also occurred in all kinds
of streams (rarely in muddy streams); however, this species was
represented by the sand-loving <i>N. d. missuriensis</i> in the Big Blue
and Little Blue rivers, and <i>N. d. deliciosus</i> in the clear, gravelly,
upland creeks (Nelson, personal communication). Because of its
widespread occurrence, and for purposes of later discussion, I refer
to this minnow also as an ubiquitous species in the Big Blue River
Basin.</p>

<p><i>Carpiodes carpio</i>, <i>Cyprinus carpio</i>, <i>I. punctatus</i>, <i>I. melas</i>, and <i>L.
humilis</i> were widespread, but each was absent or rare in one of
the kinds of streams (<a href="#Table_3">Table 3</a>). <i>Carpiodes carpio</i>, <i>Cyprinus carpio</i>,
and <i>I. punctatus</i> occurred most frequently in the sandy streams,
whereas <i>L. humilis</i> was most common in muddy streams. The high
per cent of <i>I. melas</i> in collections from the Big Blue River is a direct
result of one large population that was taken with rotenone in a
borrow-pit at Station 6-S. In my opinion, this species actually
was most abundant in the muddy streams.</p>

<p>Some fish were almost restricted to the sandy streams, apparently
because of preference for larger waters, or sandy stream-bottoms:
<i>P. olivaris</i>, <i>I. bubalus</i>, <i>H. nuchalis</i>, <i>H. aestivalis</i>, <i>A. grunniens</i>, <i>L.
osseus</i>, <i>D. cepedianum</i>, <i>N. percobromus</i>, <i>P. annularis</i>, <i>N. flavus</i>, <i>M.
aureolum</i>, <i>I. niger</i>, <i>H. alosiodes</i>, and <i>R. chrysops</i>. Other species
that were taken only in the larger rivers, and that are sometimes
associated with streams even larger (or more sandy) than the Big
Blue River are <i>H. storeriana</i>, <i>L. platostomus</i>, <i>M. salmoides</i>, <i>P. nigromaculatus</i>,
<i>C. forbesi</i>, <i>S. platorynchus</i>, <i>F. kansae</i>, <i>N. buchanani</i>,
<i>S. canadense</i>, and <i>C. auratus</i>. <i>Ictiobus cyprinella</i> also occurred
more frequently in the larger streams.</p>

<p>The muddy-bottomed streams supported populations composed
primarily of <i>P. promelas</i>, <i>N. lutrensis</i>, and <i>S. atromaculatus</i>. No
species was restricted to this habitat, but the following were
characteristic there: <i>P. promelas</i>, <i>S. atromaculatus</i>, <i>L. humilis</i>,
<i>L. cyanellus</i>, and <i>I. natalis</i>. <i>Carpiodes carpio</i>, <i>Cyprinus carpio</i>,
<i>C. anomalum</i>, <i>E. spectabile</i>, and <i>E. nigrum</i> were locally common in
muddy streams, but the first two were most frequent in larger,
sandy streams, and the last three in gravelly streams.</p>

<p>In gravel-bottomed, upland streams, <i>N. cornutus</i>, <i>N. rubellus</i>,
<i>N. topeka</i>, and <i>C. erythrogaster</i> characteristically occurred; with
the exception of <i>N. rubellus</i> (only one specimen taken), all were
common at some stations. Other species in gravelly creeks were
<i>N. lutrensis</i>, <i>C. anomalum</i>, <i>C. commersonnii</i>, <i>P. notatus</i>, <i>L. macrochirus</i>,
<i>E. spectabile</i>, and <i>E. nigrum</i>. Although the one specimen of
<i>N. umbratilis</i> taken in this survey was from the Big Blue River, this
species is more characteristic of the clearer creeks in Kansas.</p>

<p>In order to illustrate the composition of the fauna in some specific
streams in the Big Blue River Basin, I segregated the fishes into
ecological groups, as in the above discussion: ubiquitous types;
species of larger, sandy streams; fishes of muddy streams; and
fishes of clear, gravelly creeks.</p>

<p>The total number of species taken in each of the streams was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
divided into the number of species from that stream that were in
each of these units, to give a percentage. The resultant data are
presented graphically in <a href="#fig3">Figure&nbsp;3</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> gives a generalized picture of the faunal composition in
different kinds of streams. However, the fauna of a small tributary
becomes more distinct from the fauna of the larger stream into
which the small stream flows as one moves toward the headwaters
(Metcalf, 1957:92, 95-100). <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> illustrates this in Carnahan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
Creek. Station 11-G included four sampling-sites, which were approximately
one, two, three, and four miles upstream from the
mouth of Carnahan Creek. Station 13-G (one collection) was
about four miles upstream from the closest sampling-site of Station
11-G. Applying the same methods as for <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>, my findings
show a gradual decline in the per cent of the fauna represented
by the "large-river-fishes," and an increase in the segment classified
as "upland-fishes," from downstream to upstream.</p>

<a name="CREEL_CENSUS" id="CREEL_CENSUS"></a>
<div class="caption2">CREEL CENSUS</div>

<p>Fifty-three fishermen were interviewed in the 1957 creel census
period, and 152 in 1958. Only those fishermen using pole and line
were interviewed. In the area censused, much additional fishing is
done with set-lines, that are checked periodically by the owners.</p>

<p>In the 1958 census, 22 checks along approximately 80 miles of
river were made, and seven of these trips were made without seeing
one fisherman. The average fishing pressure for the entire area
was estimated at one fisherman per 7.9 miles of stream, or one
fisherman per 15.7 miles of shoreline.</p>

<p>Seven species of fish were identified from fishermen's creels in
1957 and 1958. These, in order of abundance were: channel catfish;
carp; freshwater drum; flathead catfish; shovelnose sturgeon;
smallmouth buffalo; and river carpsucker. Shovelnose sturgeon
occurred in fishermen's creels only in April, 1957, and freshwater
drum occurred more frequently in the spring-census of 1957 than
in the summer of 1958.</p>

<p>Sixty-two of the fishermen interviewed in 1958 were fishing for
"anything they could catch," 68 were fishing specifically for catfish,
and 22 sought species other than catfish. The order of preference
was as follows: channel catfish, 21.1 per cent; flathead catfish, 15.1
per cent; unspecified catfish, 12.5 per cent; carp, 9.2 per cent; freshwater
drum, 1.3 per cent; and unspecified, 40.8 per cent. The kinds
of fish desired by those fishermen checked in 1957 were not
ascertained.</p>

<p>Of all fishermen checked in 1957 and 1958, 165 were men, 17 were
women, and 24 were children. Ninety-three per cent were fishing
from the bank, five per cent were fishing from bridges, and two
per cent were wading. All but two per cent of those checked were
fishing "tightline"; the remainder fished with a cork.</p>

<p>The ten baits most commonly used, in order of frequency, were
worms, doughballs, minnows, liver, beef-spleen, chicken-entrails,
coagulated blood, crayfish, shrimp, and corn.</p>

<p>For purposes of later comparison the data on angler success
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
(<a href="#Table_4">Table 4</a>) have been divided according to areas: Area I, below
Tuttle Creek Dam; Area II, in the Tuttle Creek Reservoir area; and
Area III, above the reservoir. Areas I and III received the most
fishing pressure, especially Station 4-S (in Area I), and Station
56-S (in Area III).</p>

<p>In Area I, the success ranged from 0.91 fish per fisherman-day
in 1957 to 0.26 fish per fisherman-day in 1958. The 1957 census
was made in April and May, when fishing in warm-water streams
is considered better than in July (Harrison, 1956:203). The 1958
census was from late June through July, and stream-flow in this
period was continuously above normal. Therefore, fewer people
fished the river, and catches were irregular. Catches in 1958
ranged from 0.26 fish per fisherman-day in Area I to 0.44 fish per
fisherman-day in Area III. In 1951, in the Republican River of
Kansas and Nebraska, the average fisherman-day yielded 0.36 fish,
0.09 fish per man-hour, and 0.06 fish per pole-hour (U. S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, 1952:13-14). The average fisherman-day in the
Republican River study was 3.0 hours, whereas the average on the
Big Blue River was 2.2 hours for all areas in 1958 (<a href="#Table_4">Table 4</a>).</p>

<a name="RECOMMENDATIONS" id="RECOMMENDATIONS"></a>
<div class="caption2">RECOMMENDATIONS</div>

<p>My primary recommendation is for continued study of the
Tuttle Creek Reservoir, and the Big Blue River above and below
the reservoir, to trace changes in the fish population that result
from impoundment.</p>

<p>Probably the fishes that inhabit the backwaters, creek-mouths,
and borrow-pits in the Big Blue River Basin (gars, shad, carpsucker,
buffalo, carp, sunfishes, and white bass) will increase in abundance
as soon as Tuttle Creek Reservoir is formed. Also, as in eastern
Oklahoma reservoirs (see Finnell, <i>et al</i>., 1956:61-73), populations
of channel and flathead catfish should increase. Because of the
presence of brood-stock of the major sport-fishes of Kansas (channel
and flathead catfish, bullhead, bluegill, crappie, largemouth bass,
and white bass), stocking of these species would be an economic
waste: exception might be made for the white bass. It may be
above Tuttle Creek Dam, but was not found there.</p>

<p>I do recommend immediate introduction of walleye, and possibly
northern pike (<i>Esox lucius</i> Linnaeus), the latter species having
been successfully stocked in Harlan County Reservoir, Nebraska,
in recent years (Mr. Donald D. Poole, personal communication).
These two species probably are native to Kansas, but may have
been extirpated as agricultural development progressed. Reservoirs
may again provide habitats suitable for these species in the State.</p>

<p>If Tuttle Creek Reservoir follows the pattern found in most
Oklahoma reservoirs, large populations of "coarse fish"&mdash;fishes that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
are, however, commercially desirable&mdash;will develop (Finnell, <i>et al.</i>,
<i>loc. cit.</i>). To utilize this resource, and possibly to help control
"coarse fish" populations for the betterment of sport-fishing, some
provision for commercial harvest should be made in the reservoir.</p>

<a name="SUMMARY" id="SUMMARY"></a>
<div class="caption2">SUMMARY</div>

<p>1. The Big Blue River Basin in northeastern Kansas was studied
between March 30, 1957, and August 9, 1958. The objectives were
to record the species of fish present and their relative abundance
in the stream, and to obtain a measure of angling success prior
to closure of Tuttle Creek Dam.</p>

<p>2. Fifty-nine stations were sampled one or more times, using
seines, hoop and fyke nets, wire traps, experimental gill nets,
rotenone, and an electric fish shocker.</p>

<p>3. Forty-eight species of fish were obtained, and five others have
been recorded in literature or found in museums. One species,
<i>Carpiodes forbesi</i>, is recorded from Kansas for the first time.</p>

<p>4. <i>Notropis lutrensis</i> was the most abundant fish in the Big Blue
River Basin, followed by <i>Notropis deliciosus</i> and <i>Ictalurus
punctatus</i>. The most abundant sport-fishes were <i>I. punctatus</i>, <i>I.
melas</i>, and <i>Pylodictis olivaris</i>, respectively.</p>

<p>5. The spawning behavior of <i>Notropis lutrensis</i> is described.</p>

<p>6. A creel census at major points of access to the Big Blue River,
was taken in 1957 (below Tuttle Creek Dam) and in 1958 (above,
in, and below the dam-site). Fishing pressure averaged one fisherman
per 15.7 miles of shoreline. The average length of the fisherman-day
averaged 2.2 hours, with an average of 0.33 fish per fisherman-day
being caught in 1958. The average number of fish per
man-hour in 1958 was 0.14 and 15.8 per cent of the fishermen were
successful. Distances traveled in order to fish ranged from 0 to
197 miles (airline) and averaged 15.7 miles.</p>

<p>7. The primary recommendation is that studies be continued, to
document changes that result from impoundment. Because brood-stock
of the major sport-fishes is already present, stocking is unnecessary,
except for walleye and northern pike. Also, I recommend
commercial harvest of non-game food-fishes.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
